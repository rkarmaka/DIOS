To download the Fiji installer, please open the terminal inside your O2 Portal DesktopMate environment and run the following command:

'''
cd Downloads
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkarmaka/DIOS/main/installers/fiji_installer.sh
chmod u+x fiji_installer.sh
'''

After downloading the file, go to your Downloads folder and double click on the fiji_installer.sh file. It would automatically download the installer, install Fiji, and create an icon called Fiji on your desktop for future access.
